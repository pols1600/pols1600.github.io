# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Null and alternative hypothesis

* One-sample tests

* Two-sample tests

* Assignment 5

* Final project
]

# Hypothesis Testing

.font150[
* Goal: Try to determine whether result is due to chance or not

* Method: "Proof" by contradiction

* We try to reject the _null hypothesis_

  - _X_ is uncorrelated with/has no effect on _Y_
  - _X_ is no different from _Y_
]
---

# Proof by Contradiction

.font140[
* Formulated by Aristotle

* Starts with the _law of the excluded middle_: either a preposition is true, or its opposite is true

* $\forall P \vdash (P \lor \lnot P)$ 
]
--

.font140[
* First, we make a statement _P_, which we believe is true

* Then, we assume _P_ is false

* Lastly, we prove _P_ cannot be false given our data/reasoning

* Thus, _P_ must be true
]
---

# Hypothesis Testing

.font150[
* With statistics, we can reject the null hypothesis with 100% confidence

* Why? Because statistics is _probabilistic_

* So we use a probabilistic version of proof by contradiction
]
---

# Hypothesis Testing

.font150[
* We construct the _null hypothesis_ $\rightarrow H_0$ (what we want to refute), and the _alternative hypothesis_ $\rightarrow H_1$
 
* We select a test statistic $T$

* Figure out the sampling distribution of $T$ under $H_0$

* Is the observed value of $T$ likely to occur under $H_0$?

  - Yes - fail to reject $H_0$
  - No - reject $H_0$

* 2010 World Cup
  - Group: .orange[Germany] vs Australia

# Paul the Octopus

.font150[
* Question: Did Paul the Octopus get lucky?

* Null hypothesis: Paul is randomly choosing winner

* Test statistics: Number of correct answers

* Reference distribution: `Binomial(8, 0.5)`

* The probability that Paul gets them all correct: $\frac{1}{2^8} \approx 0.004$

# More Data about Paul

.font150[
* UEFA Euro 2008
  - Group: .orange[Germany] vs Poland
  - Group: Croatia vs .orange[Germany] (wrong)
  - Group: Austria vs .orange[Germany]
  - Quarter-final: Portugal vs .orange[Germany]
  - Semi-final: .orange[Germany] vs Turkey
  - Final: .orange[Germany] vs Spain (wrong)
  
* A total of 14 matches

* 12 correct guesses

# More Data about Paul

.font150[
* .orange[p-value:] Probability that under the null you observe something at least as extreme as what you actually observed

* $Pr({12,13,14}) \approx 0.001$

```{r paul01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
pbinom(12, size = 14, prob = 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
]
---

# P-Value

.font140[
* .orange[p-value] is the probability, computed under $H_0$, of observing a value ofthe test statistic at least as extreme as its observed value

* A smaller p-value presents stronger evidence against $H_0$

* p-value less than $\alpha$ indicates statistical significance

* $\alpha$ is usually 0.05

* .orange[Remember:] p-value is NOT the probability that $H_0$ $(H_1)$ is true (false)

* Statistical significance does not necessarily imply scientific significance
]

# One-Sample Test - Continuous Variable

.font150[
* We can also test if $\mu$ from a sample corresponds to a value we are interested in

* For example: you run a factory and want to try a new machine. Does the machine actually improve your results, or are the results just due to chance?

* R function: `t.test()`
]
---

# One-Sample Test - Continuous Variable

.font150[
* Example: 

* A bottle filling machine is set to fill bottles with soft drink to a volume of 500 ml. The actual volume is known to follow a normal distribution. The manufacturer believes the machine is under-filling bottles. A sample of 20 bottles is taken and the volume of liquid inside is measured.

# One-Sample Test - Continuous Variable

.font110[
```{r bottles01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
bottles <- c(484.11, 459.49, 471.38, 512.01, 494.48, 528.63, 493.64,
             485.03, 473.88, 501.59, 502.85, 538.08, 465.68, 495.03,
             475.32, 529.41, 518.13, 464.32, 449.08, 489.27)

mean(bottles)

t.test(bottles, mu = 500)
```
]
---

# Two-Sample Test

.font150[
* We can also test whether two different samples have the same $\mu$

* This is particularly useful for randomised experiments

* We test whether the treatment and control groups have similar means

* If so, then we conclude the treatment likely doesn't have any effect

* We use the same `t.test()` function 
]
---

# Two-Sample Test

.font120[
```{r two01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
resume <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pols1600/pols1600.github.io/master/datasets/causality/resume.csv")

call_blacks <- subset(resume$call, resume$race == "black") 
call_whites <- subset(resume$call, resume$race == "white") 

t.test(call_blacks, call_whites)
```
]
---

# t.test() or lm()?

.font110[
```{r two02,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
summary(lm(call ~ race, data = resume))
```
]
---

# t.test() or lm()?

.font150[
* Both produce exactly the same results

* The intercept in the linear model is the mean of the control group (when all other variables are zero)

* The coefficient is the average for the treatment group

* I suggest you to use `lm()`: you can add control variables, interactions, etc
