# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Questions about RMarkdown?

* What is causal inference?

* Correlation vs causation

* Treatment effects and potential outcomes

* Randomised Controlled Trials
]

---

# Brief Recap

.font150[
* Last week you learned how to:

  - Load `.csv` files 
  
  - Download datasets from the internet
  
  - Create and run `.R` scripts 
  
  - Create `.Rmd` documents (different extension!)
  
  - Print a pdf with your results

# Causal Inference

.font150[
* What is causal inference?
]
--

.font150[
* Causal: relationship where one factor causes the other
]
--
.font150[
* Inference: our ability to derive conclusion from facts and observations
]
--

.font150[
* _Causal inference is an attempt to estimate a causal connection between two variables based on an observed effect_
]

# Does X cause Y?

.font150[
* Does _X_ occur at the same time as _Y_?

* If _X_ goes up or down, does _Y_ also go up or down?

* If _X_ is happens, does _Y_ also happen?
]

.font150[* _Are X and Y causally related because of that?_]

# Causal Inference - Notation

.font150[
* Treatment variable = _T_

* Two potential outcomes = _Y_ when _T = 0_ and _Y_ when _T = 1_
]
--

.font150[
* Example

  - Treatment: getting a university degree
  
  - Potential outcome: salary with a university degree _(Y when T = 1)_ versus salary without a university degree _(Y when T = 0)_
]
---

# Causal Inference - Notation

.font150[
* The causal effect of the treatment _T_ is the difference in _Y_ with and without _T_
  
* $Y(T = 1) - Y(T = 0)$ or $Y_{1} - Y_{0}$
]

.font150[
* Why is that a problem?
]

---

# Fundamental Problem

.font150[
* _We can never observe Y where T = 1 and T = 0 at the same time_

* We only observe _one_ outcome at a time, that's why it is called the _potential_ outcomes framework
]

# Sample Average Treatment Effect

.font150[
* Solution: we estimate the _average causal effect_ in the groups that received and did not receive the treatment

* We call it the _Sample Average Treatment Effect_, or SATE
]

.center[![:scale 100%](sate.png)]

.font150[
* But is that enough?
]
--

.font150[
* _Not quite_
]

---

# Randomisation

.font130[
* The best solution to the problem of selection bias is _randomisation_

* If the researcher randomised the treatment, she can be sure that it is unrelated to any observable characteristic

* We also assume randomised treatment is uncorrelated with any _unobservable_ characteristic too

* Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs): the researcher creates treatment and control groups

* If all other characteristics are equivalent on average between the two groups, _the difference between them is caused by the treatment effect_
]
---

# Randomisation

.center[![:scale 85%](rct.png)]
---

# Internal versus External Validity

.font150[
* RCTs have very strong internal validity, that is, there is very little chance the result is derived from causes other than the treatment

* However, they may not generalise well. Why? 
]
--

.font150[
* Samples may not reflect the whole population of interest
]

# Homework

.font150[
* Watch these three videos (they're all short): 
  - <https://youtu.be/vtSCZcKXw1w>
  - <https://youtu.be/9j_HWkrSxzI> 
  - <https://youtu.be/crpuBZv6XtA> 
  

* Start `swirl()` CAUSALITY1
