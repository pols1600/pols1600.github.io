# Why Probability?

.font150[
* .orange[Probability rules our lives]
]
--
.font150[
* It is everywhere
]
--
.font150[
* However, humans are _really bad_ at interpreting probabilities

* Even worse at calculating (estimating) probabilities

* What are the chances it rains tomorrow?

* What are the chances you win the lottery?

* What is the probabilty of getting an A in POLS1600?
]

# What Is Probability

.font150[
* A mathematical model of uncertainty (chance)

* Preview: later we will use probability to make statements about uncertainty in data analysis (chapter 7)
]

# Two Concepts of Probability

.font150[
* .orange[Frequentist]: long-run frequency of events
  - Ratio between the number of times the event occurs and the number of trials
  - Example: coin flips
]
--
.font150[
* .orange[Bayesian]: subjective belief about the likelihood of event occurrence
  - Evidence based belief
  - Often more sensible philosophy in political world

# Important Terms

.font150[
* .orange[Experiment]: an action or a set of actions that producestochastic events of interest
  - coin toss, rolling a die, voting in an election
  
* .orange[Sample Space] $(\Omega)$: all possible outcomes of the experiment
  - {heads, tails}, {1,2,3,4,5,6}, {abstain, Clinton, Trump}
  
* .orange[Event]: subset of sample space
  - tails, 1, vote for Trump
]
---

# Example

.font150[
What is the experiment, sample space, and one event for coin flips or pulling a single card out of a deck of 52? 
]
---

# Example

.font140[
Probability of event A $= P(A) = \frac{\text{number of elements in A}}{\text{number of elements in sample space}}$

Probability of heads $= P(H) = \frac{heads}{heads + tails} = \frac{1}{2}$
]
--
.font140[
What is the probability of 3 heads in 3 flips?

Sample space?]
--
.font140[
$$\Omega = \{HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}$$
What is the event space we are interested in?]
--
.font150[
$$\{HHH\}$$
]
---

# Example

.font140[
What is the probability of 3 heads in 3 flips?

$$P(3 H) = \frac{\{HHH\}}{\{HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}}$$
$$P(3 H) = \frac{1}{8}$$
]
---

# Another Example

.font140[
What is the probability of at least 2 heads in 3 flips?

Sample space?]
--
.font140[
$$\Omega = \{HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}$$
What is the event space we are interested in?]
--
.font140[
$$\{HHH, HTH, THH, HHT\}$$]
--
.font140[
$$P(2 H) = \frac{4}{8}$$ 
]
---

# Axioms (Rules) of Probability

.font140[
From 3 axioms, the entire probability theory can be built
]
.font140[
* Probability of any event is non-negative:
 $$P(A) \ge 0$$
 
* Prob. that one of the outcomes in the sample space occurs is 1
$$P(\Omega) = 1$$

* .orange[Addition Rule:] If events A and B are mutually exclusive (_meaning only one can happen at a time_), then
$$P(A\ \textsf{or}\ B) \ = \ P(A) + P(B)$$
]
---

# Useful Rules of Probability

.font150[
* $A^c$ - complement to A, i.e. part of sample space not in A

* Sometimes it is easier to calculate the probability of an event by using its complement
]
---

# Useful Rules of Probability

.font150[
What is the probability of having at least one tails in 3 coin flips?]
--
.font150[
$$\Omega = \{HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}$$]
--
.font150[
P(at least one T) = $\frac{7}{8}$

P(at least one T) = $1 - P(HHH) = 1 - \frac{1}{8}$
]
---

# Example

.font150[
What is the probability of getting a Queen as the first card from a full deck?

$$\Omega = ?$$]
--
.font150[
$$P(Queen) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$$
]
---

# Permutation: When Order Matters

.font150[
* Often we do not want to or can't write out all possible combinations by hand

* How many possibilities are there to arrange letters A,B,C?]
--
.font150[
* Three outcomes: A, B, C and three draws]
--
.font150[
* First draw: A, B, or C

* Second draw: two possibilities

* Third draw: one left

* 3 x 2 x 1 possibilities 
]
---

# Permutation

.font150[
* Permutations count many ways we can .orange[order] _k_ objects out of a set of _n_ unique objects

$$_{n}P_{k} = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times (n-k + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

* What does _n!_ stand for?]
--
.font150[
* n! = n-factorial = $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times (n-n+1)$

* $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1$

* .orange[Note:] $0! = 1$
]
---

# Permutation Example

.font150[
* How many ways can we arrange four cards out of the 13 spades in our card deck?
]
--
.font150[
* first draw = ?
]
--
.font150[
* $13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10$]
--
.font150[
* $\frac{13!}{(13-4)!} = \frac{13!}{9!} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11 \times ... \times 2 \times 1}{9 \times 8 \times ... \times 2 \times 1} =$

* $13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 = 17,160$
]
---

# Combinations

.font140[
* Combinations are similar to permutations, except that the ordering doesn't matter

* So with respect to combinations of 3 out of 26 letters, ABC, BAC, CAB, etc are the same 

* There are .orange[always] fewer combinations than permutations

* Draw 2 out of letters ABC. Permutations:
]
--
.font140[
* AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB =  $\frac{3!}{1!}$

* Combinations:]
--
.font140[
* AB, AC, BC
]
---

# How to Calculate Combinations

.font150[
* Calculate permutations and then account for the fact that we overcounted due to ordering

* Get rid of counts of different arrangements of same combination: divide by $k!$

* $_{n}C_{k} = {n \choose k} = \frac{_{n}P_{k}}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$]
--
.font150[
* Why divide by $k!$ ?]
--
.font150[
* for two sampled elements, we have $2!(= 2×1 = 2): A, B = AB, BA$
]
---

# Combination Example: Winning the Lottery

.font150[
* What is the probability of winning (simplified) Mega Millions?

* Pick five numbers between 1 and 70

* Probability of getting 5 correct?

* Size of the sample space?
]
--
.font120[
$${70 \choose 5} = \frac{70!}{5! \times (70-5)!} =  \frac{70!}{5! \times 65!}$$
]
--
.font120[$$12,103,014$$]
---

# How To Solve in R

.font150[
* Just use the `choose()` function:

```{r r01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
choose(70, 5) # from 70 numbers, choose 5
```
