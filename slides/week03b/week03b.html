# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Brief revision

* Observational studies vs RCTs (QSS 2.5-2.6)

* Homework: finish `CAUSALITY01` and our first assignment 
]
---

# Revision

.font150[
* What is the fundamental problem of causal inference?
]
--
.font150[
* How can we (try to) solve that problem?
]
--
.font150[
* .orange[Randomisation]
]

---

# Randomisation

.font150[
* Randomisation ensures the treatment .orange[is not correlated] with any other variable

* Randomisation .orange[generates balance] between treatment and control groups 

* Treatment and control groups .orange[identical on average]

* Allows us to estimate the average treatment effect simply as a .orange[difference in means]: `\(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \{Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\}\)`
]

---

# Social Pressure Example

.font150[
* August 2006 Primary State-wide Election in Michigan

* Send postcards with different, randomly-assigned messages
  - no message (control group)
  - civic duty message
  - "you are being studied" message (Hawthorne effect)
  - neighbourhood social pressure message
]

---

# Social Pressure Example




```r
tapply(social$yearofbirth, social$messages, mean) # Year of Birth
```

```
## Civic Duty    Control  Hawthorne  Neighbors 
*##   1956.341   1956.186   1956.295   1956.147
```

```r
tapply(social$hhsize, social$messages, mean) # Household size
```

```
## Civic Duty    Control  Hawthorne  Neighbors 
*##   2.189126   2.183667   2.180138   2.187770
```

```r
tapply(social$primary2006, social$messages, mean) # Outcome
```

```
## Civic Duty    Control  Hawthorne  Neighbors 
*##  0.3145377  0.2966383  0.3223746  0.3779482
```

```r
tapply(social$primary2006, social$messages, mean)[-2] -
    mean(social$primary2006[social$messages == "Control"]) # SATE for each group
```

```
## Civic Duty  Hawthorne  Neighbors

# Observational Studies

.font150[
* Often, it is unethical or infeasible to randomise the treatment. 
  - Smoking and cancer 
  - Gender and salary
  - Death penalty and crime

* .orange[Observational data]: the treatment is naturally assigned
]

---

# Observational Studies 

.font150[
* Why is it harder to make causal inference with observational data? 
]

--
.font150[
* .orange[Confounders/confounding variables:] variables that are associated both with the treatment and the outcome 
]
--

.font150[
* If the treatment is not independent from pre-treatment variables, we cannot be sure about what causes what
]

---

# Examples of Confounders:

.font150[
* Are incumbents more likely to win elections?
  - Maybe, but they also receive more campaign donations
]
--

.font150[
*  Are democratic countries more peaceful than authoritarian ones?
   - Maybe, but they also tend to be richer
]

--

.font150[
* .orange[Selection bias]: groups are not directly comparable
]

---

# Observation Studies

.font150[
* Pre-treatment variables have to be .orange[controlled for], that is, _held constant_ in the analysis

* .orange[Statistical control]: we use statistical methods to create balance between treatment and control and emulate an experiment as best as we can. E.g:
  - Instrumental variables (IV)
  - Regression discontinuity designs (RDD)
  - Differences-in-differences (DD/DiD/Diff-in-diff)
]

---

# Differences-in-Differences (DiD)

.font150[
* Compare trends before and after the treatment across the same units

* Controls for the initial conditions

* Requires data for two time periods (before and after treatment) and at least two units

* .orange[Parallel time trends assumption]
]

# Minimum Wage and Unemployment

.font120[
* How does the increase in minimum wage affect unemployment?

* Economists believe the effect is positive: higher wages lead to higher unemployment

* Difficult to randomise minimum wage legislation

* In 1992, NJ minimum wage increased from $4.25 to $5.05...

* ... but neighbouring PA stays at $4.25

* NJ and (eastern) PA are similar, and fast food chains are similar too: wages, prices, products, etc

* [David Card and Alan Krueger (1994)](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf) see this change as a natural experiment
